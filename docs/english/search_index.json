Introduction\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnpm install --save tgrid\n\n\nFull name of TGrid is TypeScript Grid Computing Framework.\nAs its name suggests, TGrid is a useful framework for implementating Grid Computing in the TypeScript. With TGrid and its core concept Remote Funtion Call, you can make many computers to be a virtual computer.\nTo know more, refer below links. If you are the first comer to the TGrid, I strongly recommend you to read the Guide Documents. In article level, Basic Concepts and Learn from Examples sections would be good choices.\n\nRepositories\nGitHub Repository\nNPM Repository\n\n\nDocuments\nAPI Documents\nGuide Documents\nEnglish\n한국어\n\n\nRelease Notes\n\n\n\n1.2. Grid Computing\n\n\nComputers be a (virtual) computer\n\nAs its name suggests, TGrid is a useful framework for Grid Computing. However, perspective of Grid Computing in TGrid is something different. It doesn't mean just combining multiple computers uinsg network communication. TGrid insists the real Grid Computing must be possible to turning multiple computers into a virtual computer.\nTherefore, within framework of the TGrid, it must be possible to develop Grid Computing System as if there has been only a computer from the beginning. A program running on a single computer and another program runninng on the Distributed Processing System with millions of computers, both of them must have similar program code. It's the real Grid Computing.\nDo you agree with me?\n1.3. Remote Function Call\nTGrid realizes the true Grid Computing through Remote Function Call. It literally calling remote system's functions are possible. With the Remote Function Call, you can access to objects of remote system as if they have been in my memory from the beginning.\nWith TGrid and Remote Function Call, it's possible to handle remote system's objects and functions as if they're mine from the beginning. Do you think what that sentence means? Right, being able to call objects and functions of the remote system, it means that current and remote system are integrated into a single virtual computer.\nHowever, whatever Grid Computing and Remote Function Call are, you've only heard theoretical stories. Now, it's time to see the real program code. Let's see the demonstration code and feel the Remote Function Call. If you want to know more about the below demonstration code, read a lesson Learn from Examples wrote into the Guide Documents.\ncomposite-calculator/server.ts\nimport { WebServer, WebAcceptor } from \"tgrid/protocols/web\";\nimport { CompositeCalculator } from \"../../providers/Calculator\";\n\nasync function main(): Promise\n{\n    let server: WebServer = new WebServer();\n    await server.open(10102, async (acceptor: WebAcceptor) =>\n    {\n        await acceptor.accept(new CompositeCalculator());\n    });\n}\nmain();\n\ncomposite-calculator/client.ts\nimport { WebConnector } from \"tgrid/protocols/web/WebConnector\";\nimport { Driver } from \"tgrid/components/Driver\";\n\nimport { ICalculator } from \"../../controllers/ICalculator\";\n\nasync function main(): Promise\n{\n    //----\n    // CONNECTION\n    //----\n    let connector: WebConnector = new WebConnector();\n    await connector.connect(\"ws://127.0.0.1:10102\");\n\n    //----\n    // CALL REMOTE FUNCTIONS\n    //----\n    // GET DRIVER\n    let calc: Driver = connector.getDriver();\n\n    // FUNCTIONS IN THE ROOT SCOPE\n    console.log(\"1 + 6 =\", await calc.plus(1, 6));\n    console.log(\"7 * 2 =\", await calc.multiplies(7, 2));\n\n    // FUNCTIONS IN AN OBJECT (SCIENTIFIC)\n    console.log(\"3 ^ 4 =\", await calc.scientific.pow(3, 4));\n    console.log(\"log (2, 32) =\", await calc.scientific.log(2, 32));\n\n    try\n    {\n        // TO CATCH EXCEPTION IS STILL POSSIBLE\n        await calc.scientific.sqrt(-4);\n    }\n    catch (err)\n    {\n        console.log(\"SQRT (-4) -> Error:\", err.message);\n    }\n\n    // FUNCTIONS IN AN OBJECT (STATISTICS)\n    console.log(\"Mean (1, 2, 3, 4) =\", await calc.statistics.mean(1, 2, 3, 4));\n    console.log(\"Stdev.

Safe Implementation\nCompilation and type checking help you to implement safe network system.\n3. Block Chain\n3.1. Business Logic\nPrinciple components of Blockchain are simpler and easy to implement.\nThe core elements of Blockchain are 'Block' and 'Chain'. The first, 'Block' is a data level issue. Considers how to design the data structure and how to archive them. The second, 'Chain' is a policy issue that how to reach to an agreement when writing some data to 'Block'.\n\n\n\nComponent\nConception\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n Block\nData Structure\nWay to defining and storing data\n\n\n Chain\nRequirements\nA policy for reaching to an agreement\n\n\n\nLet's imagine a situation that develop these 'Block' and 'Chain' onto not Network System but a single computer. In that case, those skills are required:\n\nAbility to design Data Structure\nAbility to store Data on Device\nAbility to analyze policy (requirements)\nAbility to implement them\n\nThose skills are just the essentials for programmers. In other word, Business Logic of Blockchain is something that any skilled programmers can implement.\n3.2. Network System\nThe real challenge to implementing Blockchain comes from the Distributed Processing System using Network Communication.\nI said that Business Logic of Blockchain is easy. However, it's a conditional story only when developing the Blockchain programming running on a single computer. The actual Blockchain projects, they're not running only on a single computer, but on very large Distributed Processing System. The Distributed Processing System is composed with over millions of computers and they're interacting through network communications.\nThose enormous Distributed Processing Sytems always present us tremendous difficulties. Because over millions of computers are interacting together thorugh network communication, its architecutre design must be thorough and perfect. There must not be any contradiction and error. If there's an error on below step, you've to roll back whole processes and start again.\nRead Path to Hell\n1 Requirements\nTo develop a Blockchain in the traditional way, you've to hire an excellent architect.\nFirst of all, this architect collects and documets all of the requirements about the Blockchain to be newly created. If failed to discover some requirements or if some requirements are changed later, you've to restart all the processes. Thus, discovering requirements must very meticulous and detail.\n2 Analyses\nAnalyze collected requirements and discover all of the use cases perfectly. After determining these use cases, design a Conceptual Architecture. If any contraction or error was found on the collected requirements, turn back to the 1 Requirements and start everything again.\n3 Designs\nAfter Conceptual Architecture, design below architectures continuously.\n\nData Architecture\nNetwork Architecture\nSoftware Architecture\n\nThe first thing to design is the Data Architecture. It means to design the Data Model that the new Blockchain project would use. The Data Models is correspond to the 'Block'. If you've mis-designed the Data Architecture, you've retreat to current step and design it again. The step where you are, it's not a matter, so try to be sure the design it perfectly\nThe second is Network Architecture, where the design of Network Distribution is done. At first, grant each role to every computers in the Distributed Processing System. After that, define all of the network communications between participated computers. This Network Architecture may be the most difficult stage in the development processes. Also, the Network Architecture must be more perfact than any other architectures.\n\n\nDefine every moment of network transmissions and receptions\nDefine every network messages (maybe binary structure)\nDefine implications of each network message means (commands tobe executed, etc.)\n\n\nThe last is Software Architecture for individual programs running on each computer. Refering Data Architecture and Network Architecture, you'll design the Software Architectures representing what each program should implement.\n4 Implementations\nThis is the process implementing software programs for each computer participated in the Distributed Processing System. The implementation would reference pre-designed architectures. If you any error of Architecture Design was found on the implementation process, you've to retreat to the step and retart all the processes again.\nIf the error was caused by Requirements or Business Model...\n5 Conservations\nIt's the last stage verifying the designs and implementations are perfect.\nOf course, if there are any omissionss or contradctions in the development process, you have to retreat and restart the process from the beginning. For example, if the Data Architecture is invalid, the majority of the Network Architecture must be destroyed and redesigned, resulting in Software Architecture and Program Code being affected.\nOn the contrary, if the verification process confirms that all development is completed, then the Blockchain system can be operated.\n\n\nIt's tremendous difficult to develop such an actual Blockchain. No matter how simple the Business Logic is, behind it lies the path to heel, an enormous Distributed Processing System. If you want to develop a Blockchain, you've hire the excellent architects and developers, who are in the genius level. \nHowever, even those crazy architects and genius developers cannot assure the success. Even they can be fallen into the swamp due to incomplete requirement analyses or mistakes on architecture designs. I think those crazy difficulties may be a reason why many people and companies, who had made loud noises developing Blockchain, are quite in nowadays.\n3.3. Conclusion\nReading the stories, it can be summarized as 'Business Logic of Blockchain is easy, however composing its Network System is extremely difficult'.\nDo you remember? With TGrid and Remote Function Call, you can turn multiple computers into a single virtual computer. Also, program code running on the virtual computer is similar with which runs on only one computer. Only in Business Logic level, two programs' codes are perfectly same. Thus, following conclusions can be drawn:\n\nBlockchain's Business Logic is not difficult.\nWith TGrid, you can concentrate only on the Business Logic.\nThus, you can implement Blockchain easily through TGrid.\n\nAre you preparing a new Blockchain project? Then realize Grid Computing with TGrid and Remote Function Call. Focus only on the essence of the Blockchain what you want to create, Business Logic itself.\n"},"tutorial/concepts.html":{"url":"tutorial/concepts.html","title":"2.1. Basic Concepts","keywords":"","body":"Basic Concepts\nIn this lesson, we learn about the Basic Concepts of the TGrid.\nThe 1st chapter will handle about the basic theories, what the true Grid Computing being supported by TGrid and what the Remote Function Call are. In the 2nd chapter, we will learn about the basic components. Finally, the last chapter discusses two protocols supported by TGrid: Web Socket and Workers.\nIf you like practice rather than theory and prefer one code reading rather than hundreds description listenings, just skip this lesson. For those of you, I recommend you to read the next lesson, Learn from Examples, first.\n1. Theory\n1.1. Grid Computing\nWekipedia says Grid Computing is:\nWikipedia, Grid computinghttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grid_computing\nGrid computing is the use of widely distributed computer resources to reach a common goal. A computing grid can be thought of as a distributed system with non-interactive workloads that involve many files. Grid computing is distinguished from conventional high-performance computing systems such as cluster computing in that grid computers have each node set to perform a different task/application. Grid computers also tend to be more heterogeneous and geographically dispersed (thus not physically coupled) than cluster computers. Although a single grid can be dedicated to a particular application, commonly a grid is used for a variety of purposes. Grids are often constructed with general-purpose grid middleware software libraries. Grid sizes can be quite large.\nGrids are a form of distributed computing whereby a \"super virtual computer\" is composed of many networked loosely coupled computers acting together to perform large tasks. For certain applications, distributed or grid computing can be seen as a special type of parallel computing that relies on complete computers (with onboard CPUs, storage, power supplies, network interfaces, etc.) connected to a computer network (private or public) by a conventional network interface, such as Ethernet. This is in contrast to the traditional notion of a supercomputer, which has many processors connected by a local high-speed computer bus.\n\nIn the description of Wikipedia about Grid Computing, I want to emphasize the word, \"one virtual computer\". In my opinion, the true Grid Computing is not just binding multiple computers with network communication and performming common goal. I think that the true Grid Computing means makings computers to be a single virtual computer. A program running on a single computer and another program runninng on the Distributed Processing System with millions of computers, both of them must have similar program code. It's the true Grid Computing.\nDo you agree with me?\n1.2. Remote Function Call\n\nI think the real Grid Computing means turning multiple computers into a single virtual computer. Also, code of the program mounted on the virtual computer must be similar with the code running on a single physical computer.\nTGrid realizes the true Grid Computing through Remote Function Call. It literally calling remote system's functions are possible. With the Remote Function Call, you can access to objects of remote system as if they have been in my memory from the beginning.\nWith TGrid and Remote Function Call, it's possible to handle remote system's objects and functions as if they're mine from the beginning. Do you think what that sentence means? Right, being able to call objects and functions of the remote system, it means that current and remote system are integrated into a single virtual computer.\n1.3. Demonstration\nIn the previous chapter, I mentioned that TGrid and Remote Function Call can turn multiple computers into a single virtual computer. Also, the program code of the virtual computer is similar with another program code running on a single physical computer.\nThus, in this section, I will show you some brief demonstration codes. The demonstrations will proof the Remote Function Call can make multiple computers to be a single virtual computer. Also, we need to take a look at how the code using the Remote Function Call.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHierarchical\nComposite\nSingle\n\n\n\nThree demonstration codes are all come from the 2.2. Learn from Examples lesson. Read the lesson if you want to know more about those demonstration codes. At now, we'll only concentrate one thing. That is, business code of those demonstration codes are all similar.\nWhether the program you want to create is built with Grid Computing or runs on a single computer, there is no change in the business logic code. Even if you have two or four computers that make up Grid Computing, there is still no change in your business logic code. Because they are all integrated into one (virtual) computer. How can you make different programs for the same purpose running on a single computer?\nI'll conclude this chapter with these words, \"This is TGrid. This is Remote Function Call\".\n\n  \n    Hierarchical\n    Composite\n    Single\n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \nimport { WorkerConnector } from \"tgrid/protocols/workers\";\nimport { Driver } from \"tgrid/components\";\n\nimport { ICompositeCalculator } from \"../../controllers/ICalculator\";\n\nasync function main(): Promise\n{\n    //----\n    // CONNECTION\n    //----\n    // DO CONNECT\n    let connector: WorkerConnector = new WorkerConnector();\n    await connector.connect(__dirname + \"/calculator.js\");\n\n    //----\n    // CALL REMOTE FUNCTIONS\n    //----\n    // GET DRIVER\n    let calc: Driver = connector.getDriver();\n\n    // FUNCTIONS IN THE ROOT SCOPE\n    console.log(\"1 + 6 =\", await calc.plus(1, 6));\n    console.log(\"7 * 2 =\", await calc.multiplies(7, 2));\n\n    // FUNCTIONS IN AN OBJECT (SCIENTIFIC)\n    console.log(\"3 ^ 4 =\", await calc.scientific.pow(3, 4));\n    console.log(\"log (2, 32) =\", await calc.scientific.log(2, 32));\n\n    try\n    {\n        // TO CATCH EXCEPTION IS STILL POSSIBLE\n        await calc.scientific.sqrt(-4);\n    }\n    catch (err)\n    {\n        console.log(\"SQRT (-4) -> Error:\", err.message);\n    }\n\n    // FUNCTIONS IN AN OBJECT (STATISTICS)\n    console.log(\"Mean (1, 2, 3, 4) =\", await calc.statistics.mean(1, 2, 3, 4));\n    console.log(\"Stdev.

Driver\nDriver of Controller for Remote Function Call\nDriver is an object for calling functions of the remote system. It is designed to specify a generic parameter Controller. Through the Driver, you can call functions of the Provider, provided from the remote system. In other words, Remote Function Call means to call functions of Provider, provided from the remote system, through the Driver.\nAlso, when you assign a Controller into the generic parameter of Driver, the return type of all functions defined in the Controller would be promisified. If an internal object exists in the target Controller, the object type would be converted as Driver. Since those conversions are recursviely repeated, all the functions defined in the Controller would be promisified, regardless of their hierarchy depth.\ntype Driver = \n{\n    plus(x: number, y: number): Promise;\n    minus(x: number, y: number): Promise;\n    multiplies(x: number, y: number): Promise;\n    divides(x: number, y: number): Promise;\n\n    readonly scientific: Driver;\n    readonly statistics: Driver;\n};\n\nDriver ignores atomic variablesIn Driver, all of the atomic variables like number and string are being ignored.\nAs you can see from the below code, all of the atomic variables defined in the Controller are disappeared. Therefore, when designing a Provider and you want to provide atomic variables to the remote system, you should define a getter or setter method like below.\n\nSomething.getValue()\nSomething.setValue()\n\ninterface ISomething\n{\n    getValue(): number;\n    setValue(val: number): void;\n\n    value: number;\n}\n\ntype Driver = \n{\n    getValue(): Promise;\n    setValue(val: number): Promise;\n};\n\n\n3.

The second is WebAcceptor class, which is created whenever a client connects to the WebServer and taking responsibility to RFC communication with the client. The last is WebConnector class, which is designed for Web Socket client.\nBetween those classes, Communicator classes are WebAcceptor and WebConnector. Of course, WebServer can certianly open a WebSocket server and creates WebAcceptor objects whenever client connects, however, it's never the Communicator class using the RFC.\n3.2.

Outline\nTGrid supports Worker and SharedWorker protocols.\nWhy workers be categorized into network system\nWorker is invented for supporting multi-threading in the web browsers. However, unlike threads in normal programming languages, workers cannot share memory variables. As workers cannot share memory variables, interactions with web browser and worker (or with worker and worker) are implemented by [MessageChannel] which utilizes binary data communication.\nInteractions are done by not sharing memory variables but binary communcation? Isn't this where you heard a lot? That's right, it's the most typical form of distributed processing system using network communication. In other words, MessageChannel used by workers is same with the network communication, in the conceptual level.\nLet's review the workers. Workers are physically created in the thread level. However, in conceptual level and considering how they interact, workers are a type of network system. In such reason, TGrid interpretes Worker and SharedWorker as network protocols and supports Remote Function Call for those protocols.\n\n3.2.2. Tutorials\nTGrid provides detailed API Documents for protocols.workers module. Also, example codes and demo projects using Worker protocol are already prepared. I recommend you to utilze not only API Documents but also below example codes and demo projects.\n\nExample Codes\nObject Oriented Network\nRemote Critical Section\n\n\nDemo Project\nGrid Market\n\n\n\n3.2.3.

The first is Worker and the other is SharedWorker. The key differences of two categories are their cardinalities between server and clients; Worker is 1: 1 and SharedWorker is 1: N.\nWorkerConnector  creates a Worker instance and the Worker instances opens WorkerServer. After the instance creation, WorkerConnector  connects to the WorkerServer directly and communicates with Remote Function Call. Note that, the WorkerServer can accept only a connection, a WorkerConnector who created the Worker instance.\n\nWorkerConnector  creates a new Worker instance\nThe new Worker instance opens WorkerServer\nWorkerConnector  and WorkerServer interact with RFC\n\nIt is a bit unusual for the SharedWorkerConnector. SharedWorkerConnector create a new SharedWorker instance before connection if target file has not mounted yet, otherwise just connects to ordinary SharedWorker instance if target file has already been mounted. By such characteristics, SharedWorkerServer can accept multiple connections like WebServer. Of course, Communicator classes, reponsible for RFC communication, of the SharedWorker are SharedWorkerConnector and SharedWorkerConnector.\n\nSharedWorkerConnector creates a new or brings an existing SharedWorker instance.\nThe SharedWorker instance opens SharedWorkerServer if newly created.\nSharedWorkerAcceptor and SharedWorkerConnector interact with RFC\n\nSharedWorker for NodeJSSharedWorker is a technology that only web browsers support, and NodeJS cannot use it.\nHowever, SharedWorker can be very powerful weapon. In my opinion, SharedWorker can be a great solution for simulating the Web Socket server. Also, developing NodeJS program, I often desire the SharedWorker to develop common background process.\nSo I'm planning to build a polyfill library that can use SharedWorker in the NodeJS. However, I still don't know how to implement it. If anyone reading this article knows how to build the polyfill library, please help me.\n\nhttps://github.com/samchon/tgrid/issues\n\n\n"},"tutorial/examples.html":{"url":"tutorial/examples.html","title":"2.2.

Also, let's take a look at the code of Remote Function Call and demonstrate how the Remote Function Call come true the word: computers to be a computer. \n\nDemonstration of TGrid, who makes computers to be a computer\n1. Remote Function Call\n2. Remote Object Call\n3. Object Oriented Network\n4. Remote Critical Section\n\n\n\n1. Remote Function Call\nLet's see what Remote Function Call and how to use it with the below example code. What we're going to implement in this chapter is a remote calculator. The server provides a simple arithmetic calculator and client uses it ti perform calculations through the Remote Function Call.\n\nServer: Provides arithmetic operations\nClient: Use it\n\n1.1. Features\nISimpleCalculator is an interface that defines the functions provided to client from the server. Some of you may have noticed already. Ues, ISimpleCalculator is the Controller. Then, what is the role of SimpleCalculator? Right, it's the Provider class provided from server to client.\n\n../controllers/ICalculator.ts\n../providers/Calculator.ts\n\n\n  \n    Controller\n    Provider\n  \n  \n    \n      \n        export interface ISimpleCalculator\n{\n    plus(x: number, y: number): number;\n    minus(x: number, y: number): number;\n    multiplies(x: number, y: number): number;\n    divides(x: number, y: number): number;\n}\n\n      \n    \n    \n      \n        Controller\n        \n          export interface ISimpleCalculator\n{\n    plus(x: number, y: number): number;\n    minus(x: number, y: number): number;\n    multiplies(x: number, y: number): number;\n    divides(x: number, y: number): number;\n}\n\n        \n      \n      \n        Provider\n        \n          import { ISimpleCalculator } from \"../controllers/ICalculator\";\n\nexport class SimpleCalculator implements ISimpleCalculator\n{\n    public plus(x: number, y: number): number\n    {\n        return x + y;\n    }\n    public minus(x: number, y: number): number\n    {\n        return x - y;\n    }\n\n    public multiplies(x: number, y: number): number\n    {\n        return x * y;\n    }\n    public divides(x: number, y: number): number\n    {\n        if (y === 0)\n            throw new Error(\"Divided by zero.\");\n        return x / y;\n    }\n}\n\n        \n      \n    \n  \n\n1.2. Server\nAs I mentioned, the role of server in this example is to providing arithmetic calculator for the client. Therefore, server program code is very simple. Just opens a server and provides arithmetic calculator SimpleCalculator (be Provider) to clients who access to server.\nsimple-calculator/server.ts\nimport { WebServer, WebAcceptor } from \"tgrid/protocols/web\";\nimport { SimpleCalculator } from \"../../providers/Calculator\";\n\nasync function main(): Promise\n{\n    let server: WebServer = new WebServer();\n    await server.open(10101, async (acceptor: WebAcceptor) =>\n    {\n        await acceptor.accept(new SimpleCalculator());\n    });\n}\nmain();\n\n1.3. Client\nFinally, the time to make the long-awaited client program has come. If you compare two example codes, you may find a fact: Two codes are similar. You can see that (a program code connecting to server and using remote calculator provided from server as a client) and (another program code using its own calculator as a single program), both of them have similar program code.\nIn technical terms, it's considered as \"Bsuiness Logic code is perfectly similar\". Of course, two program codes are not 100% matched, because of domain logics like client should connect to server or an extra symbol await is required for the Remote Function Call. However, the Business Logic portion of the two codes is completely homogeneous in fundamental level. Therefore, it helps us to separating Business Logic from Network System perfectly. do you agree?\nThe ability to call a networked remote system freely of its functions, just like it was my memory object from the beginning. This is the Remote Function Call.\nSomething to be aware ofOn the 17 th line, you can see that after the client has finished connecting to the server, it constructs a DriverController> object, by calling the connector.getDriver() method from Communicator, for preparing the remote function calls.\nAs you can see, all of the remote function calls to remote system's Provider are always done through this DriverController> object. It would be repeated in all tutorial lessons. Thus, please be aware of it, the DriverController>.\n\nsimple-calculator/client.ts\n\n  \n    Remote-Function-Call\n    Single-Program\n  \n  \n    \n      \n        import { WebConnector } from \"tgrid/protocols/web\";\nimport { Driver } from \"tgrid/components\";\nimport { ISimpleCalculator } from \"../../controllers/ICalculator\";\n\nasync function main(): Promise\n{\n    //----\n    // CONNECTION\n    //----\n    let connector: WebConnector = new WebConnector();\n    await connector.connect(\"ws://127.0.0.1:10101\");\n\n    //----\n    // CALL FUNCTIONS\n    //----\n    // GET DRIVER\n    let calc: Driver = connector.getDriver();\n\n    // CALL FUNCTIONS WITH AWAIT SYMBOL\n    console.log(\"1 + 3 =\", await calc.plus(1, 3));\n    console.log(\"7 - 4 =\", await calc.minus(7, 4));\n    console.log(\"8 x 9 =\", await calc.multiplies(8, 9));\n\n    // TO CATCH EXCEPTION IS ALSO POSSIBLE\n    try \n    {\n        await calc.divides(4, 0);\n    }\n    catch (err)\n    {\n        console.log(\"4 / 0 -> Error:\", err.message);\n    }\n\n    //----\n    // TERMINATE\n    //----\n    await connector.close();\n}\nmain();\n\n      \n    \n    \n      \n        Remote-Function-Call\n        \n          import { WebConnector } from \"tgrid/protocols/web\";\nimport { Driver } from \"tgrid/components\";\nimport { ISimpleCalculator } from \"../../controllers/ICalculator\";\n\nasync function main(): Promise\n{\n    //----\n    // CONNECTION\n    //----\n    let connector: WebConnector = new WebConnector();\n    await connector.connect(\"ws://127.0.0.1:10101\");\n\n    //----\n    // CALL FUNCTIONS\n    //----\n    // GET DRIVER\n    let calc: Driver = connector.getDriver();\n\n    // CALL FUNCTIONS WITH AWAIT SYMBOL\n    console.log(\"1 + 3 =\", await calc.plus(1, 3));\n    console.log(\"7 - 4 =\", await calc.minus(7, 4));\n    console.log(\"8 x 9 =\", await calc.multiplies(8, 9));\n\n    // TO CATCH EXCEPTION IS ALSO POSSIBLE\n    try \n    {\n        await calc.divides(4, 0);\n    }\n    catch (err)\n    {\n        console.log(\"4 / 0 -> Error:\", err.message);\n    }\n\n    //----\n    // TERMINATE\n    //----\n    await connector.close();\n}\nmain();\n\n        \n      \n      \n        Single-Program\n        \n          import { SimpleCalculator } from \"../../providers/Calculator\";\n\nfunction main(): void\n{\n    //----\n    // CALL FUNCTIONS\n    //----\n    // CONSTRUCT CALCULATOR\n    let calc: SimpleCalculator = new SimpleCalculator();\n\n    // CALL FUNCTIONS DIRECTLY\n    console.log(\"1 + 3 =\", calc.plus(1, 3));\n    console.log(\"7 - 4 =\", calc.minus(7, 4));\n    console.log(\"8 x 9 =\", calc.multiplies(8, 9));\n\n    // TO CATCH EXCEPTION\n    try \n    {\n        calc.divides(4, 0);\n    }\n    catch (err)\n    {\n        console.log(\"4 / 0 -> Error:\", err.message);\n    }\n}\nmain();\n\n        \n      \n    \n  \n\n\n1 + 3 = 4\n7 - 4 = 3\n8 x 9 = 72\n4 / 0 -> Error: Divided by zero.\n\n\n2. Remote Object Call\nIn the previous chapter, we've learned how to call functions of remote system. However, the previous chapter handled only singular structured object which defined all functions in its root scope. Therefore, we've never handled the composite structure.\nWhat if the remote object you want to use is a composite structure? What if the final remote function you want to call is placed into deep depth hierarchy with stack of objects? In this case, TGrid's answer is simple and clear.\nTGrid saysJust use it~!\n\n2.1. Features\nIn this chapter, we'll demonstrate the Remote Object Call using CompositeCalculator. The CompositeCalculator class extends the SimpleCalculator to keep supporting four arithmetic operations continuosly. Also, supports scientific and statistics calculators with internal objects. Therefore, CompositeCalculator is a typical of composite structured class.\nI think you may already know that, the CompositeCalculator would be Provider in the server. Also, ICompositeCalculator would be a Controller in the client.\n\n../controllers/ICalculator.ts\n../providers/Calculator.ts\n\n\n  \n    Controller\n    Provider\n  \n  \n    \n      \n        export interface ICompositeCalculator \n    extends ISimpleCalculator\n{\n    scientific: IScientific;\n    statistics: IStatistics;\n}\n\nexport interface ISimpleCalculator\n{\n    plus(x: number, y: number): number;\n    minus(x: number, y: number): number;\n    multiplies(x: number, y: number): number;\n    divides(x: number, y: number): number;\n}\nexport interface IScientific\n{\n    pow(x: number, y: number): number;\n    sqrt(x: number): number;\n    log(x: number, y: number): number;\n}\nexport interface IStatistics\n{\n    mean(...elems: number[]): number;\n    stdev(...elems: number[]): number;\n}\n\n      \n    \n    \n      \n        Controller\n        \n          export interface ICompositeCalculator \n    extends ISimpleCalculator\n{\n    scientific: IScientific;\n    statistics: IStatistics;\n}\n\nexport interface ISimpleCalculator\n{\n    plus(x: number, y: number): number;\n    minus(x: number, y: number): number;\n    multiplies(x: number, y: number): number;\n    divides(x: number, y: number): number;\n}\nexport interface IScientific\n{\n    pow(x: number, y: number): number;\n    sqrt(x: number): number;\n    log(x: number, y: number): number;\n}\nexport interface IStatistics\n{\n    mean(...elems: number[]): number;\n    stdev(...elems: number[]): number;\n}\n\n        \n      \n      \n        Provider\n        \n          import { \n    ICompositeCalculator, \n    ISimpleCalculator, IScientific, IStatistics\n} from \"../controllers/ICalculator\";\n\nexport class SimpleCalculator \n    implements ISimpleCalculator\n{\n    public plus(x: number, y: number): number\n    {\n        return x + y;\n    }\n    public minus(x: number, y: number): number\n    {\n        return x - y;\n    }\n\n    public multiplies(x: number, y: number): number\n    {\n        return x * y;\n    }\n    public divides(x: number, y: number): number\n    {\n        if (y === 0)\n            throw new Error(\"Divided by zero.\");\n        return x / y;\n    }\n}\n\nexport class CompositeCalculator \n    extends SimpleCalculator \n    implements ICompositeCalculator\n{\n    public scientific = new Scientific();\n    public statistics = new Statistics();\n}\n\nexport class Scientific implements IScientific\n{\n    public pow(x: number, y: number): number\n    {\n        return Math.pow(x, y);\n    }\n\n    public log(x: number, y: number): number\n    {\n        if (x \n        \n      \n    \n  \n\n2.2.

Client\nIn the client program, Controller has been changed from ISimpleCalculator to ICompositeCalculator. Also, scopes of target functions have been changed from root scope to composite scope. But as you can see, no problem on the remote function calls.\nI named remote function calls to composite scoped objects as \"Remote Object Call\" and distinguished it from Remote Function Call. However, they're same in the fundamental level.

Remote Object Call again but with a little bit different; Hierarchical Calculator. Previous CompositeCalculator has a scientific and statistics calculators as internal member objects. In the new HierarchicalCalculator, we would create in this chapter, those scientific and statistics calculators would be separated into independent servers.\nIt means that we need split one calculator server into three different servers. At first, we'll create two new servers responsible for scientific and statistics calculations. At last, we'll make a mainframe server responsible for 4 arithmetic operations itself and shifting responsibilities to related servers about scientific and statistics operations; calculator.\nAfter we've built all of the servers, we should make the client program using the Hierarchical Calculator. Would the Business Logic be kept despite of critical change on the network system's structure? Let's demonstrate it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComposite Calculator\nHierarchical Calculator\n\n\n\n3.1. Features\nIn this section, Controllers used by mainframe server are IScientific and ISatistics. Also, Controller used by the client program is ICompositeCalculator. Wait a minute! Controller of the client program is exactly same with the previous chapter 2. Remote Object Call. Have you noticed or felt something? \nCongratulations if you've understood how to implement the Hierarchical Calculator, just by looking at the Controllers. You've already understood everything about the TGrid.\n\n../controllers/ICalculator.ts\nhierarchical-calculator/calculator.ts#L7-L13\n\n\n  \n    Controller\n    Provider\n  \n  \n    \n      \n        export interface ICompositeCalculator \n    extends ISimpleCalculator\n{\n    scientific: IScientific;\n    statistics: IStatistics;\n}\n\nexport interface ISimpleCalculator\n{\n    plus(x: number, y: number): number;\n    minus(x: number, y: number): number;\n    multiplies(x: number, y: number): number;\n    divides(x: number, y: number): number;\n}\nexport interface IScientific\n{\n    pow(x: number, y: number): number;\n    sqrt(x: number): number;\n    log(x: number, y: number): number;\n}\nexport interface IStatistics\n{\n    mean(...elems: number[]): number;\n    stdev(...elems: number[]): number;\n}\n\n      \n    \n    \n      \n        Controller\n        \n          export interface ICompositeCalculator \n    extends ISimpleCalculator\n{\n    scientific: IScientific;\n    statistics: IStatistics;\n}\n\nexport interface ISimpleCalculator\n{\n    plus(x: number, y: number): number;\n    minus(x: number, y: number): number;\n    multiplies(x: number, y: number): number;\n    divides(x: number, y: number): number;\n}\nexport interface IScientific\n{\n    pow(x: number, y: number): number;\n    sqrt(x: number): number;\n    log(x: number, y: number): number;\n}\nexport interface IStatistics\n{\n    mean(...elems: number[]): number;\n    stdev(...elems: number[]): number;\n}\n\n        \n      \n      \n        Provider\n        \n          import { Driver } from \"tgrid/components\";\n\nimport { SimpleCalculator } from \"../../providers/Calculator\";\nimport { IScientific, IStatistics } from \"../../controllers/ICalculator\";\n\nexport class HierarchicalCalculator \n    extends SimpleCalculator\n{\n    // REMOTE CALCULATORS\n    public scientific: Driver;\n    public statistics: Driver;\n}\n\n        \n      \n    \n  \n\n3.2. Servers\nhierarchical-calculator/scientific.ts\nLet's create scientific calculator server. It seems very easy, isn't it?\nimport { WorkerServer } from \"tgrid/protocols/workers\";\nimport { Scientific } from \"../../providers/Calculator\";\n\nasync function main(): Promise\n{\n    let server: WorkerServer = new WorkerServer();\n    await server.open(new Scientific());\n}\nmain();\n\nhierarchical-calculator/statistics.ts\nImplementing statistics calculator server is also very easy, too.\nimport { WorkerServer } from \"tgrid/protocols/workers\";\nimport { Statistics } from \"../../providers/Calculator\";\n\nasync function main(): Promise\n{\n    let server: WorkerServer = new WorkerServer();\n    await server.open(new Statistics());\n}\nmain();\n\nhierarchical-calculator/calculator.ts\nNow, it's time to create the mainframe server.\nMainframe server computes four arithmetic operations by itself. The scientific and statistics operations are shifted to related servers and the mainframe server only intermediates computation results. It means that mainframe server has implementation code about the four arthmetic operations and scientific and statistics operations are done by DriverController> objects interacting with related servers.\nAs a result, the HierarchicalCalculator is same with previous chapter's CompositeCalculator in logically. Although detailed implementation codes of two classes are something different, they have same interface and also provide same features. Now, can't you imagine the client's implementation code, even if you haven't seen the example code?\n\n  \n    Object-Oriented-Network\n    Remote-Object-Call\n  \n  \n    \n      \n        import { WorkerServer, WorkerConnector } from \"tgrid/protocols/workers\";\nimport { Driver } from \"tgrid/components\";\n\nimport { SimpleCalculator } from \"../../providers/Calculator\";\nimport { IScientific, IStatistics } from \"../../controllers/ICalculator\";\n\nclass HierarchicalCalculator extends SimpleCalculator\n{\n    // REMOTE CALCULATOR\n    public scientific!: Driver;\n    public statistics!: Driver;\n}\n\nasync function get\n    (path: string): Promise>\n{\n    // DO CONNECT\n    let connector = new WorkerConnector();\n    await connector.connect(__dirname + \"/\" + path);\n\n    // RETURN DRIVER\n    return connector.getDriver();\n}\n\nasync function main(): Promise\n{\n    // PREPARE REMOTE CALCULATOR\n    let calc = new HierarchicalCalculator();\n    calc.scientific = await get(\"scientific.js\");\n    calc.statistics = await get(\"statistics.js\");\n\n    // OPEN SERVER\n    let server = new WorkerServer();\n    await server.open(calc);\n}\nmain();\n\n      \n    \n    \n      \n        Object-Oriented-Network\n        \n          import { WorkerServer, WorkerConnector } from \"tgrid/protocols/workers\";\nimport { Driver } from \"tgrid/components\";\n\nimport { SimpleCalculator } from \"../../providers/Calculator\";\nimport { IScientific, IStatistics } from \"../../controllers/ICalculator\";\n\nclass HierarchicalCalculator extends SimpleCalculator\n{\n    // REMOTE CALCULATOR\n    public scientific!: Driver;\n    public statistics!: Driver;\n}\n\nasync function get\n    (path: string): Promise>\n{\n    // DO CONNECT\n    let connector = new WorkerConnector();\n    await connector.connect(__dirname + \"/\" + path);\n\n    // RETURN DRIVER\n    return connector.getDriver();\n}\n\nasync function main(): Promise\n{\n    // PREPARE REMOTE CALCULATOR\n    let calc = new HierarchicalCalculator();\n    calc.scientific = await get(\"scientific.js\");\n    calc.statistics = await get(\"statistics.js\");\n\n    // OPEN SERVER\n    let server = new WorkerServer();\n    await server.open(calc);\n}\nmain();\n\n        \n      \n      \n        Remote-Object-Call\n        \n          import { WebServer, WebAcceptor } from \"tgrid/protocols/web\";\nimport { CompositeCalculator } from \"../../providers/Calculator\";\n\nasync function main(): Promise\n{\n    let server: WebServer = new WebServer();\n    await server.open(10102, async (acceptor: WebAcceptor) =>\n    {\n        await acceptor.accept(new CompositeCalculator());\n    });\n}\nmain();\n\n        \n      \n    \n  \n\n3.3. Client\nThe Provider class HierarchicalCaluclator is same with previous chapter's CompositeCalculator in logically. Also, they have same interface although their detailed implementation codes are slightly different.\nIt means that the client program of this chapter can re-use the ICompositeCalculator, which had been used in the previous chapter 2. Remote Object Call. Controller is same with previous chapter and Business Logic is also same. Therefore, these two client programs would have similar implementation code. Le'ts looko at the below codes and find what is different.\n\nHave you ever found anything different?The 11th to 12th lines are slightly different. The server address to connect is different.\n\nThis is the TGrid. It's not a matter whether the system you want to imlement is a program that runs on a single computer or a distributed processing system using network communications. Even within the same network system category, it's no problem how its distributed architecture is constructed. Just remember this one.\nWith TGrid, your Business Logic codes are always similar in any situation.\nhierarchical-calculator/index.ts\n\n  \n    Object-Oriented-Network\n    Remote-Object-Call\n    Single-Program\n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \nimport { WorkerConnector } from \"tgrid/protocols/workers\";\nimport { Driver } from \"tgrid/components\";\n\nimport { ICompositeCalculator } from \"../../controllers/ICalculator\";\n\nasync function main(): Promise\n{\n    //----\n    // CONNECTION\n    //----\n    // DO CONNECT\n    let connector: WorkerConnector = new WorkerConnector();\n    await connector.connect(__dirname + \"/calculator.js\");\n\n    //----\n    // CALL REMOTE FUNCTIONS\n    //----\n    // GET DRIVER\n    let calc: Driver = connector.getDriver();\n\n    // FUNCTIONS IN THE ROOT SCOPE\n    console.log(\"1 + 6 =\", await calc.plus(1, 6));\n    console.log(\"7 * 2 =\", await calc.multiplies(7, 2));\n\n    // FUNCTIONS IN AN OBJECT (SCIENTIFIC)\n    console.log(\"3 ^ 4 =\", await calc.scientific.pow(3, 4));\n    console.log(\"log (2, 32) =\", await calc.scientific.log(2, 32));\n\n    try\n    {\n        // TO CATCH EXCEPTION IS STILL POSSIBLE\n        await calc.scientific.sqrt(-4);\n    }\n    catch (err)\n    {\n        console.log(\"SQRT (-4) -> Error:\", err.message);\n    }\n\n    // FUNCTIONS IN AN OBJECT (STATISTICS)\n    console.log(\"Mean (1, 2, 3, 4) =\", await calc.statistics.mean(1, 2, 3, 4));\n    console.log(\"Stdev.

The example codes I've shown you throughout this lesson are also intended to demonstrate such concept.\nHowever, the the single virtual program doens't mean the single-threaded program. Rather, it is more like a multi-threading (or multi-processing) program in logically. In other words, all of the systems made by TGrid are a type of virtual multi-threading programs.\nSo, what do you imagine when you hear the word multi-thread? Perhaps most of you thought about the critical sections like mutex or semaphore. Yes, the most important thing for multi-threading program is to controll these critical sections carefully.\nAlthough you succeeded to turn multiple computers using network communications into a single virtual computer through TGrid, it doesn't mean anything if cannot controll those critical sections. Thus, in this chapter, we will learn how to control these critical sections in network system. However, do not worry, it's never difficult. Controlling network level's critical sections are also done by the Remote Function Call.\nRecommend a LibraryTSTL\nTypeScript Standard Template Library\n\nhttps://tstl.dev\n\nI strongly recommend a library named TSTL, which supports controlling critical sections through  module. The classes implemented in the  module can be used not only in the single program level, but also in the network level.\nMutex used in this chapter is also imported from the TSTL.\nimport {\n    ConditionVariable,\n    Mutex, TimedMutex,\n    SharedMutex, SharedTimedMutex,\n    UniqueLock, SharedLock,\n    Latch, Barrier, FlexBarrier,\n    Semaphore\n} from \"tstl/thread\";\n\n\n4.1. Features\nController and Provider to be used for controlling remote section are as follows. The client program provides the CriticalSection object as a Provider. Also, the server program utilizes the remote Provider through DriverController> with ICriticalSection.\nAs you can see, the features are very simple. IMutex would be used to control critical section in the server program. Also, server program would utilize the ICriticalSection.print() method. Let's take a look what the method is for.\n\n  \n    Controller\n    Provider\n  \n  \n    \n      \n        export interface ICriticalSection\n{\n    mutex: IMutex;\n\n    print(character: string): void;\n}\n\ninterface IMutex\n{\n    lock(): void;\n    unlock(): void;\n}\n\n      \n    \n    \n      \n        Controller\n        \n          export interface ICriticalSection\n{\n    mutex: IMutex;\n\n    print(character: string): void;\n}\n\ninterface IMutex\n{\n    lock(): void;\n    unlock(): void;\n}\n\n        \n      \n      \n        Provider\n        \n          import { Mutex } from \"tstl/thread/Mutex\";\n\nexport class CriticalSection\n{\n    public mutex: Mutex = new Mutex();\n\n    public print(character: string): void\n    {\n        process.stdout.write(str);\n    }\n}\n\n        \n      \n    \n  \n\n4.2. Client\n\nThe client program creates 4 Worker instances and the 4 Worker instances construct 4 WorkerServers objects. Also, provides CriticalSection classes to each server as a Provider. After the construction, client program waits until 4 WorkerServers to be closed.\nAs you can see, the actions of the client program is simple. It just provides CriticalSection object to each server. The important is how each server controls the critical section in network level using the Remote Function Call.\nthread/index.ts\nimport { WorkerConnector } from \"tgrid/protocols/workers\";\n\nimport { Vector } from \"tstl/container\";\nimport { Mutex } from \"tstl/thread\";\n\n// FEATURES TO PROVIDE\nnamespace provider\n{\n    export var mutex = new Mutex();\n    export function print(str: string): void\n    {\n        process.stdout.write(str);\n    }\n}\n\nasync function main(): Promise\n{\n    let workers: Vector> = new Vector();\n\n    // CREATE WORKERS\n    for (let i: number = 0; i \n4.3. Server\nServer program controls the critical section in network level through the Mutex which is provided from the client program.\nAs you can see, the server programs picks a random character up (line #38). After that, monopolizes critical section for 1 to 2 seconds and prints the picked up character repeatedly,  (line #19 to #33).\nIf the Remote Function Call can control the critical sections even in the network level, the console will repeat the same characters on each line. Otherwise the TGrid and TSTL failed to control the critical sections in network level, the console will print dirty characters.\nNow, let's see what happend to the console. The TGrid even can implement the remote critical section?\nthread/child.ts\nimport { WorkerServer } from \"tgrid/protocols/workers\";\nimport { Driver } from \"tgrid/components\";\n\nimport { Mutex, sleep_for } from \"tstl/thread\";\nimport { randint } from \"tstl/algorithm\";\n\ninterface IController\n{\n    mutex: Mutex;\n    print(str: string): void;\n}\n\nasync function main(character: string): Promise\n{\n    // PREPARE SERVER\n    let server: WorkerServer = new WorkerServer();\n    await server.open();\n\n    // REMOTE FUNCTION CALLS\n    let driver: Driver = server.getDriver();\n    await driver.mutex.lock();\n    {\n        // PRINT LINE WITH CRITICAL SECTION\n        for (let i: number = 0; i \n\n11111111111111111111\n88888888888888888888\n44444444444444444444\n33333333333333333333\n\n\n"},"tutorial/projects/":{"url":"tutorial/projects/","title":"2.3.

Outline\n\nCreate a simple live chat application.\n\nDemo site: http://samchon.org/chat\nCode repository: https://github.com/samchon/tgrid.projects.chat\n\nWhen practicing network programming, most of them start from creating live chat application. We'll also follow the custom. As the first example project of TGrid, we will create a live chat server program. We will also create a client program (web application) to participate in the chat.\nHowever, since Chat Application is the first tutorial project of the TGrid, we will make it very simple with low difficulty. There will only be one chat room on the server. Therefore, all clients connecting to the server will gather and talk together. The client application will also be made very simple with ReactJS.\nIf you are curious about the code of a chat application with multiple rooms, please refer to this next example project,  Othello Game. Of course, the sbuject is Othello Game, as you can see, but there are a number of rooms in the game, where players and observers can talk to each other.\n2. Design\n\nThe Chat Application we'll build is very simple. There is only one chat room on the server, and all clients connecting to that server will only talk to each other here. Therefore, the features server and client must provide to each other is also very concise.\nThe features must be provided from server to clients are, just let client to set its name and let having conversation with each other. The other features provided fromn clients to server are much easier and simpler, which can be summarized in just one word. It is informing the client what happened in the chat room.\n\nWhat the server must provide to clients\nto specify name\nto talk to everyone\nto whisper to an individual\n\n\nWhat clients must provide to the server\nto add and remove participants\nto print conversation content\nto print whispered content\n\n\n\n3. Implementation\n3.1. Features\ncontrollers/IChatService.ts\nIChatService is a Controller defining provided freatures from server to clients. Precisely, the client programs call remote functions using the DriverIChatService> object.\nSo what's the first thing a client connecting to a server should do? It's just naming itself (setName). After that, the client will talk to everyone (talk) or whisper to a special participant (whisper).\n404: Not Found\n\ncontrollers/IChatPrinter.ts\nIChatPrinter is a Controller defining provided features from client to server. Precisely, the server program call remote functions using the DriverIChatPrinter> object.\nAlso, looking at the functions defined in the IChatPrinter, its purpose is clearly shown up. The purpose is, the client wants server to inform it what is happening in the chat room.\nServer informs clients which participants are nelwy come and which participants are existed by calling insert or erase methods of DriverIChatPrinter> object. Also, server delivers conversations by calling talk and whisper methods of the DriverIChatPrinter> object.\n404: Not Found\n\n3.2. Server Program\nproviders/ChatService.ts\nChatService is a Provider class provided from server to client. \nAt the same time, ChatService has a responsibility to propagating events from chat room to all participants. Whenever client remotely call functions of ChatService using DriverIChatService, the ChatService object delivers the event to all of the participants using participants_: HashMap>.\nWhen a client has ben disconnected, main function of the server program calls ChatService.destructor() to inform other participants. Of course, same member variable participants_: HashMap> would be used again.\n404: Not Found\n\nserver.ts\nThe main code of the server program is really simple.\nYou can create a websocket server and provide a ChatService object as a Provider to each client . When the client closes the connection, call the ChatService.destructor() method to remove the client from the chat room's participants list.\n404: Not Found\n\n3.3. Client Application\nproviders/ChatPrinter.ts\nChatPrinter is a Provider class provided from client to server .\nWhenever server remotely calls function of ChatPrinter using DriverIChatPrinter>, ChatPrinter archives writes it into its member variables. After the archiving, ChatPrinter calls the event listener (which registerted into listener_: ()=>void through assign() method) to inform ChatMovie that something has been changed in the chat room.\n404: Not Found\n\napp.tsx\nThe main function code of the client program is also very short and simple.\nThe main function connects to the websocket chat server and moves to the JoinMovie. JoinMovie is designed to set your name to join the chat room, but it would be much better to see its detailed code by yourself.\n404: Not Found\n\nmovies/JoinMovie.tsx\nIn JoinMovie is desinged to set name and inform it to server.\nWhen user inputs its name and clicks the \"Participate in\" button, JoinMovie remotely calls ChatService.setName() method using DriverIChatService> object. If returned type is Array of string which means participants of the chat room, then JoinMovie converts screen to ChatMovie directly.\n404: Not Found\n\nmovies/ChatMovie.tsx\nConversations are done in the ChatMovie.\nWhen user inputs conversation or whisper to someone, ChatMovie remotely calls server's method through DriverIChatService>; ChatService.talk() or ChatService.whisper().\nAlso, ChatMovie registers an event listeners to the ChatPrinter. Therefore, whenever the event listener is called, ChatMovie refreshes the screen immediately and it helps ChatMovie to keep the most-up-date screen of the chat room continuosly.\n404: Not Found\n\n"},"tutorial/projects/othello.html":{"url":"tutorial/projects/othello.html","title":"2.3.2.
