Make a simple live chat application.

When practicing network programming, most of them start from creating live chat application. We'll also follow the custom. The first tutorial project [Chat Application](chat-application.md) is very easy and simple. There is only a chat room on the server and all participants are paritipated in there.




## [2. Omok Game](omok-game.md)
Make an online Omok game.

However, we'll not create a simple game only can play an Omok game. The difficulty would be higher than previous lesson [1. Chat Application](#1-chat-application), so multiple game rooms would be existed. People can participate in each room as a game player or observer watching players' game. Also, partipants in each room can conversate with each other.


  - Multiple Games Rooms
    - Can join as a game player
    - Can participate as observer
    - Can conversate with each other




## [3. Grid Market](grid-market.md)
![Actors](../../../assets/images/projects/grid-market/actors.png)

Create an online *Market* which intermediates computing resources for *Grid Computing*. Also, creates participants of the *Market*, *Consumer* and *Supplier* who can trade the computing powers. At last, makes the Monitor who can observe all of transactions occured in the *Market*.

Of course, this is a tutorial project for helping you. Therefore, the *Market* does not require real monetary. However, sharing computing resources are not fake but real. All of the interactions between Market, Consumer nad Supplier would be real things.

  - `Market`: An intermediary market where you can trade computing resources.
  - `Consumer`: Purchases and use the computating power from the *Supplier*.
  - `Supplier`: Provides its computing resource to *Consumer*.
  - `Monitor`: Observe all of the transactions in the *Market*.
